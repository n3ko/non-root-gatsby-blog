Although you can get a unique domain name at <https://wordpress.com/>, there is option to get a better domain name by hosting it yourself.

One way is to download the source code from <https://wordpress.org/>, but I did it by One-click install on DigitalOcean, in order to reuse my existing domain name. It was quite easy.
