What I find to be important are, of course, security. The close second is ease of editing / customization. The third is beauty.

- 2FA -- I use WordFence
- Login notifier

Ease of editing

- What The File by Never5
- Enable Markdown with Jetpack

Beauty

- Better comment system -- wpDiscuz
- Tag Cloud by Azure curve
