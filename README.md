# non-root-gatsby-blog

An attempt to create a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) blog as a part of Monorepo, with [/data](/data) and `/dist` (output-dir) directories sticking out, instead of being inside [the Gatsby repo](/packages/gatsby-blog-cli).

I also created this from scratch, partly by following <https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-developer-blog-from-scratch-with-gatsby-and-mdx/>
